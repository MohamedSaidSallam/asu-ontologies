## Problem Statement

It's the modeling of a university system using an RDF that allows us to encode semantic relationships so that we can interpret them computationally and use queries to get the required pieces of data in an organized system. The system consists of Students, Courses, Trainings and Instructors where the instructors hold courses and some of them are advisors.
